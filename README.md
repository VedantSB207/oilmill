The next steps would involve refining and expanding THIS application to make it more robust, user-friendly, and feature-rich. Here are some suggestions for what you can consider working on:

1. **User Authentication and Security:**
   Implement a secure user authentication system to ensure that only authorized users can access the application. Use proper encryption and authentication mechanisms to protect user data.

2. **Data Visualization:**
   Enhance the user interface by incorporating data visualization tools, such as graphs and charts, to present the tabular data in a more visually appealing and informative manner.

3. **Data Filtering and Sorting:**
   Allow users to filter and sort the displayed data based on specific criteria, such as date ranges, machine numbers, or names. This will help users quickly find the information they need.

4. **Data Export and Reports:**
   Provide options for users to export data in different formats (e.g., CSV, Excel) and generate detailed reports for analysis or record-keeping purposes.

5. **Error Handling and Validation:**
   Implement proper error handling and validation mechanisms to ensure that user inputs are accurate and that the application gracefully handles any unexpected situations.

6. **User Profiles and Management:**
   Create a user management system where administrators can add, modify, or deactivate user accounts. Assign appropriate roles and permissions to each user.

7. **Notifications and Alerts:**
   Implement a notification system to alert users about important events, such as maintenance schedules, low stock levels, or critical issues.

8. **Backup and Recovery:**
   Set up a regular data backup system to prevent data loss. Implement a recovery mechanism to restore data in case of system failures.

9. **Performance Optimization:**
   Optimize the application's performance to handle a larger user base and data volume. Consider techniques such as database indexing and caching.

10. **Multi-Platform Compatibility:**
    If applicable, consider making the application accessible across different platforms, such as web browsers, mobile devices, or desktop applications.

11. **Usability Testing:**
    Conduct usability testing with actual users to gather feedback and identify areas for improvement. Continuously refine the user interface based on user input.

12. **Documentation:**
    Create comprehensive documentation that explains how to use the application, its features, and any technical aspects for both users and administrators.
